  "about_title": "Welcome to my shop 'Crazy Leather Things'.",
  "about": "Hello! My name is Olga. I have always been a creative person with several hobbies. Since childhood I loved to do handmade: knitting, embroidering, sewing, and doing something new and interesting. But for many years now, all my energy has been focused on the one thing - working with the leather. In 2011, I had a favorite backpack, which eventually wore out and I needed a new one. At that time I could not find a similar backpack in the stores and decided to try sewing the backpack by myself. I took my leather jacket and undo it the seams. The next step, I made a pattern on an old backpack and sewed myself a new backpack that I use to this day. I did it! I really enjoyed working with leather and I, inspired by new and new successes, began to sew bags and wallets for myself and my relatives (yes, they were really lucky). I don’t have a mentor, so I studied on my own, looking for information in all possible sources: the Internet, books, magazines. Then my friends began to contact me with requests to sew some thing. When a few years ago I saw leather goods with embossed , I really fell in love with this technique, but I was afraid to try make it by myself. My husband convinced me that I have to learn this skill too. I've begun to learn! I get inspiration from my relatives, from nature, from my favorite music and from my second hobby - embroidery. In several things I mixed the technique of working with leather and embroidery. Too many products are inspired by my favorite music: rock-a-billy, rock'n'roll .... I am currently working in different styles and directions with various skin. Usually, I invent the design by myself. It often happens that I see a drawing and it captures me so much that I won't calm down until I thought up where to apply it. The next step I make with this pattern any thing - it can be a handbag, purse, jewelry, patch or key chain. I also work under the order on the personal design of the customer. I do not have assistants, I do everything on my own and only with my own hands - from the development of the model, the patterns, the embossing, the processing, the painting and the completion of the product. The name of my shop, which we invented together with my husband, is explained by the fact that I often make absolutely impossible leather goods according to the design and complexity. I am very glad that my favorite hobby has turned into my favorite work and I am ready to present my works in this store. Here you can find or order a wide variety of original and exclusive products only my hand made, that is, in a single copy.",
